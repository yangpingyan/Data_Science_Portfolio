# Data Science Portfolio
 
This is a repository of the projects I worked on or currently working on. It is updated regularly. The projects are either written in R (R markdown) or Python (Jupyter Notebook). The goal of the projects is to use data science/statistical modelling techniques to find something that is interesting. A typical project consist of finding and cleaning data, analysis, visualization and conclusion. Click on the projects to see full analysis and code.
